# ETCC Meetup Notes & Links

Notes and Links shared at the East Troy Computer Club meetups. Usually, each meetup comes with notes put together by the presenter and members like you. Instead of sharing slides on SlideShare or Prezi, We thought a public code repo would be most interesting. Feel free to fork and improve upon. We want this collection of material to mean something. To have some weight and hopefully help others.

## Organization of Meetups

Each Meetup is represented by a folder. It's naming convention is important;

    etcc-YYYYY-MM-DD-slug-title

So an example would be:

    etcc-02013-09-25-meet-greet-set-tone-pace

Within these folders there is no standard practices. Yet.
